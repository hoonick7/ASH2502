4. Add the crumbled feta cheese, chopped olives, and sun-dried tomatoes to the wet ingredients and stir until well combined.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until just combined (the batter should still be slightly lumpy).
6. Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the center of the waffle iron and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the waffles are golden brown and crispy.
7. Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the waffle iron with a little bit of oil between each use.

**Tips:**

* For an extra burst of flavor, add some chopped Greek sun-dried peppers or artichoke hearts to the batter.
* If you want a more authentic Greek experience, serve the waffles with a dollop of tzatziki sauce (yogurt, cucumber, garlic, and dill) on top!
* Experiment with different types of cheese, such as graviera or kefalograviera, for a unique flavor profile.

* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp smoked paprika (optional)
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 tbsp freshly squeezed orange juice
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 tbsp harissa chili paste (Moroccan hot sauce)
* 2 bay leaves
* 10-12 metal skewers

**instructions:**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, chopped onion, garlic, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), coriander powder, salt, and black pepper.
2. Add the lamb or beef pieces to the marinade and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Preheat your grill or broiler to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated meat onto the metal skewers, leaving a small space between each piece.
4. Place the skewers on the grill or under the broiler and cook for 8-10 minutes per side, or until the meat is cooked through and slightly charred.
5. While the kebabs are cooking, mix together orange juice, lemon juice, and harissa chili paste in a small bowl. Brush this mixture onto the kebabs during the last 2 minutes of cooking.
6. Remove the skewers from the heat and garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro. Serve immediately with couscous, rice, or grilled vegetables.

**Tips:**

* Traditionally, Moroccan barbecued meat is cooked on a grill over an open flame. If you have access to such a setup, use it! Otherwise, your broiler will do the trick.
* You can also add other ingredients like chopped bell peppers, zucchini, or mushrooms to the skewers for added flavor and texture.
* For a spicier kick, increase the amount of harissa chili paste in the marinade and brushing mixture.",5,5,5
